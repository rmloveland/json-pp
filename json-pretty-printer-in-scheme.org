* Pretty-Printer
** Overview

  Command-line pretty-printer will read from stdin and print to
  stdout.

** Algorithm

  There will be a global variable, *indent-by*, which will tell us
  how many characters to indent by.

  Begin reading in characters from standard input one at a time.
  Every time you read an ``indented'' character:
  
  1. Print the character
  2. Print a newline
  3. Increment `indent-by' by some agreed-upon value /n/
  5. Indent by `indent-by' characters

  Every time you read an ``outdented'' character:

  1. Print a newline
  2. Indent by `indent-by' characters
  3. Print the character
  4. Print a newline
  5. Decrement `indent-by' by /n/
  6. Indent by `indent-by' characters

     
  The comma is a special case:

  1. Print the character
  2. Print a newline
  3. Indent by `indent-by' characters (as is)
